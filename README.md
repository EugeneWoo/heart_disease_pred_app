Testing out my first app deployed to Streamlit community cloud. 

The user inputs their age, gender, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol, and receives a prediction of their probability of suffering from heart disease. The model is Random Forest with the hyperparameters {max_depth=5, min_samples_leaf=10, n_estimators=10, n_jobs=-1, random_state=42}.
